Today I was invited to give a seminar at the Austrian Academy of Science at [RICAM](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/ricam/), in the Computational Methods for PDEs group. I had the opportunity to present our work on reduced-order modelling and recent hybridisation of the PGD with the Finite Element Neural Network Interpolation (FENNI) framework.
