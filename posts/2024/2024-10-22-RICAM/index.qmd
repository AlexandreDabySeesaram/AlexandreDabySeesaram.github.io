Today I was invited to give a seminar at the Johann Radon Institute for Computational and Applied Mathematics ([RICAM](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/ricam/)) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, in the Computational Methods for PDEs group. I had the opportunity to present our work on reduced-order modelling and recent hybridisation of the PGD with the Finite Element Neural Network Interpolation (FENNI) framework.
