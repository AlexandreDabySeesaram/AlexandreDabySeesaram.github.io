I am Alexandre Daby-Seesaram,
a Postdoctoral researcher at École Polytechnique and INRIA in the MΞDISIM team.

I hold a Ph.D. in computational mechanics from the University Paris-Saclay (ENS Paris-Saclay) where I worked at the LMPS (Laboratory of Mechanics Paris-Saclay).

My main research interest consists of solving highly nonlinear problems using model-order reduction techniques such as the Proper Generalised Decomposition (PGD). I've recently become interested in hybridising classical model-order reduction methods with machine learning approaches. The combined use of tensor decomposition and interpretable neural networks enables efficient and robust solving of large non-linear problems.
