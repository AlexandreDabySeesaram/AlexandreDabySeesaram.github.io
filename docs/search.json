You can learn more about my background on my [CV].\nMy main research interest consists of solving highly non-linear problems using model-order reduction techniques such as the Proper Generalised Decomposition (PGD). I’ve recently become interested in hybridising classical model-order reduction methods with machine learning approaches. Combining tensor decomposition and interpretable neural networks enables efficient and robust solving of large non-linear problems."
