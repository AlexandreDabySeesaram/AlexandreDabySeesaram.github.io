# Welcome, 
I'm Alexandre Daby-Seesaram, a Postdoctoral researcher at École Polytechnique and INRIA in the <a href="https://m3disim.saclay.inria.fr/">MΞDISIM team</a>.

I hold a Ph.D. in <b>computational mechanics</b> from the University Paris-Saclay (ENS Paris-Saclay), where I worked at the LMPS (Laboratory of Mechanics Paris-Saclay). You can learn more about my background in my <a href="Resources/Documents/CV.pdf">[CV]</a>. 

My main research interest consists of solving highly non-linear problems using <b>model-order reduction</b> techniques such as the Proper Generalised Decomposition (PGD). I've recently become interested in hybridising classical model-order reduction methods with machine learning approaches. Combining tensor decomposition and interpretable neural networks enables efficient and robust solving of large non-linear problems.
